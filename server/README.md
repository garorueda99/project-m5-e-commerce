# Backend

# E-commerce API docs

The E-commerce API is a REST API for an E-commerce App. It offers a limited subset of the kinds of things you can do on a regular E-commerce App.
At this time, there is no user authentication. Instead, a hardcoded user is always logged in as `garo99`. You cannot log out, or switch users for now.

# Setup and ports

Run `yarn install` to install dependencies, you must be at .\project-m5-e-commerce\server>. From there you can also execute `yarn start` and will start the backend up

By running `yarn start` from the root .\project-m5-e-commerce> it will run at the same time the client and the server sides.

The server runs on port _4000_, so you can access the server at `http://localhost:4000/`. As a test, you can go to `http://localhost:4000/api/me/profile`. You should see a JSON object shown in the browser:

```json
{
  "profile": {
    "id": "garo99",
    "displayName": "Andrea, Aml",
    "avatarSrc": "/assets/user1.jpg",
    "location": "Whitehall, London",
    "email": "garo99@gmail.com"
  }
}
```

# Endpoints

Endpoints are grouped into 3 categories:

- **buyer** - relating to users/buyers
- **seller** - Relating to sellers/companies
- **items** - single item / group of filtered items / info about available categories or body locations

## Buyer Endpoints

This endpoint control user-specific things: getting buyer info

### GET /api/me/profile

Get the profile for the currently-logged-in user.

Should come in this structure:

```json
{
  "profile": {
    "id": "garo99",
    "displayName": "Andrea, Aml",
    "avatarSrc": "/assets/user1.jpg",
    "location": "Whitehall, London",
    "email": "garo99@gmail.com"
  }
}
```

## Seller Endpoints

These endpoints control seller-specific things: getting seller info

### GET /api/seller/:sellerId

Get the profile for a specific seller.

Should come in this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Barska",
  "url": "http://www.barska.com/",
  "country": "United States",
  "_id": 19962
}
```

## Item Endpoints

### GET /api/item/:itemId

Returns data about the specified item.

Example:

```json
 {
    "name": "Ekho Fit-18 Heart Rate Monitor 12-2042",
    "price": "$105.99",
    "body_location": "Wrist",
    "category": "Fitness",
    "_id": 6549,
    "imageSrc": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/.............more",
    "numInStock": 0,
    "companyId": 17748
  },
```

### PUT /api/item/reduce

Reduces the inventory once a sale has been posted

**Important**: You'll need to specify the quantity to reduce from the inventory with a JSON body:

```json
{ "6547": 3, "6625": 2 }
```

If everything goes well, you'll get a response that looks like this:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

You'll get an error if you try to sell more than the quantity available

## Filtered Endpoints

## OPTION 1

### GET <POST> /api/items

- if body not present will sent firts 30,
- if body will send result according to the filter parameters

A group of items selected by:

- **"keyword":** "Ekho" ==> the word is included in the name. Doesn't not requiere a exact match of capital letters. Type: string

- **"price_range":** [0, 105.99] ==> the product is widthin the range (min, max). If the array has more than 2 elements, the elements after the secondone won't be taken into account. Type: array of two elements = [type: float, type: float]

- **"body_location":** "Wrist" ==> all product for the same body location [<location1, location2,..., locationN>].Doesn't not requiere a exact match of capital letters.
  Type: array of many elements as body_locations [Type: string,...., Type: string]

- **"category":** ["Fitness"] ==> all product for the same category [<category1>,. <category2>,..., <categoryN>]Doesn't not requiere a exact match of capital letters.
  Type: array of many elements as categories [Type: string,...., Type: string]

- **"query_result_maxqty":** 10, ==> # of results of filterd products that the front wants to receive [<qty to return>] Type: integer

- **"available":** true/false ==> the product is available in the inventory.
  True = more than 0 on hand / False = no available. Type: boolean

- **"companyId":** Products of the same company. Type: integer

- **"initial_index":** This will let the back know where in the array found will start sending the info. E.G. It was found 230 items. but will sent up 30.
  therefore if you need the next 30, it will requiere that this is set as 31. Type: integer

**Important**: You'll need to specify the filters with a JSON body:

```json
{
  "keyword": "Ekho",
  "price_range": "[0, 105.99, exact]",
  "query_result_maxqty": "10"
}
```

All Products endpoints return data in the following structure:

totalFound: returns the total amount of items found with the query ðŸ‘†
Result: returns the number of items found up to 30. If the query ðŸ‘† includes _query_result_maxqty_ parameter it will return as many items as defined there, up to 30.

Because the Back-end probably won't pass all items the response will include the  
"nextIndex" key. that let know the front-end what index should request to show when the user ask for more items or qhen rendering E.G. page 2 of 4 or page 3 of 4, etc

```json
{
  "nextIndex": 6,
  "totalFound": 269,
  "result": [
    {
      "name": "Ekho Fit-18 Heart Rate Monitor 12-2042",
      "price": "$105.99",
      "body_location": "Wrist",
      "category": "Fitness",
      "_id": 6549,
      "imageSrc": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/ygggL/AMGYKotCZZn5dlb8842LzMyrOtIO4ToAn0AhuG8EEB6ggggCCCCAIIIIAggggCCCCA//2Q==....more",
      "numInStock": 0,
      "companyId": 17748
    },
    {
      "name": "Ekho FiT-9 Women's Heart Rate Monitor 12-2041",
      "price": "$95.12",
      "body_location": "Wrist",
      "category": "Medical",
      "_id": 6550,
      "imageSrc": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/VKqIgIiICIiAiIgIiICIiD//Z........more",
      "numInStock": 2,
